In Progress For school early gameplay footage(Subject to change): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uORUe47fXLc
This is a OpenWorld project I chose to start building with a friend of mine in school for our class and now I plan on finsihing it by myself to see what I can make out of it! I find open World games to be fun so I chose to start there to see how the process of it is.
